# Golang Base Project

## Archived

I am no longer maintaining this project. As an alternative consider checking out [pocketbase](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase).

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/uberswe/golang-base-project?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/uberswe/golang-base-project)

A minimal Golang project with user authentication ready out of the box. All frontend assets should be less than 100 kB on every page load. 

See a live example at: [https://www.golangbase.com](https://www.golangbase.com)

Projects that used this template as a starting point:
 
 - [tournify/web](https://github.com/tournify/web) - A website for creating tournaments
 - [uberswe/domains-sweden](https://github.com/uberswe/domains-sweden) - Search all of Sweden's .SE and .NU domains

Functionality includes:

 - Login
 - Logout
 - Register
 - User Activation
 - Resend Activation Email
 - Forgot Password
 - Admin Dashboard
 - Search
 - Throttling

This easiest way for me to achieve this was with a database. I decided to use [GORM](https://gorm.io/docs/) which should fully support MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server and Clickhouse or any other databases compatible with these dialects.

The frontend is based off of examples from [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/).

## Getting started

You can run this with go by typing `go run cmd/base/main.go` and the entire project should run using an sqlite in-memory database.

You can also use Docker.

### Docker

A dockerfile and docker compose file is provided to make running this project easy. Simply run `docker-compose up`.

You will need to change the env variables for sending email, when testing locally I recommend [Mailtrap.io](https://mailtrap.io/).

If you want to change the docker-compose file I recommend making a copy and overriding the base file with your own file like so `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build -d`.

### Environment variables

This project uses environment variables and there are several ways to set them. If you are using docker see the article [Environment variables in Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/). Twilio has a more general guide on [how to set environment variables for Windows, Mac OS and Linux](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html).

The following variables can currently be set:

#### PORT

Port sets the port that the application should listen on for HTTP requests. A common port is 8080 and if you run the application locally you should see the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

#### BASE_URL

This url is mainly used for emails since it is considered unsafe to fetch the current url from headers. This should be set to url of the domain you are hosting the project on.

#### COOKIE_SECRET

This is the key used to authenticate the cookie value using HMAC. It is recommended to use a key with 32 or 64 bytes. This will default to a random 64 byte key if no value is set. Please read more about keys on [gorilla/securecookie](https://github.com/gorilla/securecookie).

If you don't set this to a value you might get an error like `ERROR! securecookie: the value is not valid` this is because a new key is generated every time you start the application and you have old cookies in your browser with an invalid HMAC.

#### DATABASE

The database you would like to use such as `mysql` or `sqlite`. See the [GORM documentation for more supported databases](https://gorm.io/docs/connecting_to_the_database.html).

#### DATABASE_HOST

The database host is usually localhost if running on the same machine or the container name, `db` in our case, if running with docker. If you have a remote database host you would set this to the ip or domain of that host.

#### DATABASE_PORT

The port of the database host.

#### DATABASE_USERNAME

Username used to authenticate to the database.

#### DATABASE_PASSWORD

Password used to authenticate to the database.

#### SMTP_USERNAME

Username used for authentication when sending emails over SMTP. For local development you can try using a free service like [Mailtrap.io](https://mailtrap.io/).

#### SMTP_PASSWORD

Password used for authentication when sending emails over SMTP.

#### SMTP_HOST

Host used for sending emails over SMTP.

#### SMTP_PORT

The port for the host used for sending emails over SMTP.

#### SMTP_SENDER

This will be the email shown in the `From:` field in emails.

#### STRICT_TRANSPORT_SECURITY

This will enable or disable strict transport security which sets a header that forces SSL. [Read more about HSTS here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security).

#### REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE

Used for throttling requests on authentication related endpoints. This value is how many times requests can be made per minute. Set to 5 by default.

#### CACHE_PARAMETER

This parameter is added to the end of static assets like so `/assets/js/main.js?c=rLWjPDCQTh`. A random one is set by default every time the application starts but you can set the `CACHE_PARAMETER` variable if you would like to control this in some other way.

#### CACHE_MAX_AGE

Sets the max-age time in seconds for the `Cache-Control` header. By default this header is set to 1 year.

## Project structure

This is the latest way I like to organize my projects. It's something that is always evolving and I know some will like this structure while others may not and that is ok. 

I have mixed in the frontend assets with the go project. The `/src` folder has js and css assets for the frontend which are compiled and put into `/dist` where all the html templates also are.

I create packages when I feel there is a need for them to be shared at different levels of the project such as in another package or the routes, my rules here are very flexible and I have yet to come up with a good rule. Packages are in folders like `/middleware`, `email`, `util` and `config`.

You can run this project with a single go file by typing `go run cmd/base/main.go`.

There is a `/models` package which contains all the database models.

The `/routes` package contains all the route functions and logic. Typically, I try to break of the logic into other packages when functions become too big but I have no strict rule here.

All in all I have tried to keep the project simple and easy to understand. I want this project to serve as a template for myself and perhaps others when you want to create a new website.

## Dependencies

I have tried to keep the dependencies low, there is always a balance here in my opinion and I have included the golang vendor folder and compiled assets so that there is no need to download anything to use this project other than the project itself.

### Go Dependencies

The following dependencies are used with Go.

 - [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) - A web framework which makes routes, middleware and static assets easier to use and handle.
 - [GORM](https://gorm.io/index.html) - An ORM library to make writing queries easier.

### NPM Dependencies

I personally dislike NPM because I there seems to be so many dependencies in javascript projects often with vulnerabilites which are hard to fix. However, npm is also one of the easiest ways to build an optimized frontend today which can be modified and built upon by others. I have tried to keep dependencies low and most are only used for the compiling of the static assets.

 - [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) - Bootstrap 5 is a frontend framework that makes it easy to create a good looking website which is responsive.
 - [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - An easy way to bundle and compile assets.
 - [sass-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-loader) - To compile scss files from bootstrap together with custom styles added by me.
 - [PurgeCss](https://purgecss.com/) - PurgeCss removes unused CSS so that we only load what is needed. Since we have Bootstrap our compiled css would be around 150kB without PurgeCSS compared to around 10kB as it is now.

There are some more dependencies but I have focused on mentioning those that have the greatest impact on the project as a whole.

## GitHub Actions

There is a workflow to deploy to my personal server whenever there is a merge to master. This is the way I like to deploy for personal projects. The steps are:

 - Make a new image with docker
 - Push this image to a private container registry on my server, you can see the registry here https://registry.beubo.com/repositories/20
 - Then I use docker-compose to pull the latest image from the private registry

I use [supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/production/) to run my containers. [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) handles the SSL configuration and routing. I use [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html) to manage my configurations.

## Translations

This project uses [go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) to handle translations. Only English and Swedish is currently supported, but I would gladly add more languages if someone would like to contribute.

To update languages first run `goi18n extract` to update `active.en.toml`. Then run `goi18n merge active.*.toml` to generate `translate.*.toml` which can then be translated. Finally, run `goi18n merge active.*.toml translate.*.toml` to merge the translated files into the active files.
